# longitudinal-breast-density
The code here allows you to calculate a longitudinal breast density measure using more than one BI-RADS breast density. The main file is the R file ("calc-long-density"), which includes the code needed to calculate the longitudinal measure of breast density. It also requires the RData file ("model_output"), which includes the model parameters. There is another RData file ("exampledata") containing example data for multiple fictional women, and this illustrates the required format for inputting the data.
